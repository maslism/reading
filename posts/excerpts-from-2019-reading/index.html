<p>“Yes, I feel the same way. Friends should enjoy seeing each other face to face. Talking over the phone is considered having contact, but you haven’t seen each other, and what you say over the phone can’t be kept like a letter to be taken out and read over several times. A phone call is a lazy man’s visit or a miser’s letter, not what you would expect from a friend. Besides, did you notice that a person’s voice over the phone often sounds unrecognizable or unpleasant?” <br>

<p>Science studies facts, religion speaks about values, and never the twain shall meet. Religion has nothing to say about scientific facts, and science should keep its mouth shut concerning religious convictions. If the Pope believes that human life is sacred, and abortion is therefore a sin, biologists can neither prove nor refute this claim. As a private individual, each biologist is welcome to argue with the Pope. But as a scientist, the biologist cannot enter the fray. This approach may sound sensible, but it misunderstands religion. Though science indeed deals only with facts, religion never confines itself to ethical judgements. Religion cannot provide us with any practical guidance unless it makes some factual claims too, and here it may well collide with science. The most important segments of many religious dogmas are not their ethical principles, but rather factual statements such as ‘God exists’, ‘the soul is punished for its sins in the afterlife’, ‘the Bible was written by a deity rather than by humans’, ‘the Pope is never wrong’. These are all factual claims. Many of the most heated religious debates, and many of the conflicts between science and religion, involve such factual claims rather than ethical judgements. <br>

<p>If we wanted to stay in the eurozone, I told them, we could not possibly confiscate the ECB’s money. If, on the other hand, we wanted Grexit, then there was something useful we could do with the cash without being branded thieves: we could nationalize the €16 billion, stamp the notes with special ink to invalidate them as euros and rebrand them as new drachmas, put them in the ATMs and use them as a new currency. We would have to apologize to Mario Draghi, explain that we were in a national emergency and ask him to tell us what the paper value of his €16 billion cash was so that we could compensate him. I also reiterated my own view, which was that we should do none of this but instead activate the electronic parallel payments system that I had been preparing. This would extend our fiscal space within the euro even if we did ultimately reach a good agreement with the troika, and if there was no agreement, it would buy us time or, in the most extreme scenario of Grexit, serve as the foundation of a new digital national currency. Naturally Lafazanis liked the idea of using Draghi’s €16 billion as the foundation for a new drachma and agreed, were we to do so, that the ECB should be compensated for the production costs of the bills.

Sustained growth had lifted the ceiling on the economy but at the same time spread a new social disease. Production no longer satisfied real wants.

For socialist leaders, who bore the scars of austerity from their own upbringing, there was a simple moral logic why rent should be virtually free while a TV cost a monthly salary of 1,500 marks or more. The first was a ‘basic need’, the latter a ‘luxury’. Luxury taxes and sumptuary legislation were nothing new, of course, but historically these had sought to shore up hierarchies, not to break them down. It was a counterproductive mix. The regime was effectively subsidizing a new class of consumers. Cheap housing left better-earning professionals and the intelligentsia with a vast unspent income. The result was a consumerist pressure cooker, as high-income groups competed for everything, from cars to fridges and showerheads. In the 1950s, collectivization, education reform (and bourgeois flight) had advanced social equality in East Germany.

At the same time, Mao struck at the family as an outdated feudal institution. Women and youth were mobilized against their elders and given a whole new sense of self. The aim was to transfer their allegiance from their husbands and fathers to the collective.

To make it worthwhile, people try to get more out of free time by consuming more things more quickly and superficially.

A study of five European cities in 2002 found that, everywhere, waste was the one environmental issue that mattered most to consumers. Using second-hand goods and eating less meat, by contrast, ‘were not important at all’.133 This is a dangerously lop-sided state of affairs. For the planet, re-using glass bottles and separating food waste is a nice gesture, but it is the busy, energy-hungry lives we lead at home and on the roads and in the air that are the real threat. Domestic waste needs to be put in perspective. In a rich society such as Britain, almost a third of all CO2 emissions come from our homes. Personal travel raises it to 47 per cent.

<p>Still, in the OECD as a whole, there has been no absolute fall in material appetite. The outlook gets more worrying when we quantify all the resources that are being used in the process of creating our material world – from oil, coal and aluminium all the way to the cement needed to build not only apartments but the shops and service centres of our allegedly ‘dematerialized’ lifestyles. In 2010, the latest available data, total material consumption in the OECD was 45 gigatonnes, the equivalent of 100kg per person per day.8 That is a lot of stuff. The immediate challenge is not a scarcity of materials as such, but the pollution, conflict and environmental damage that currently goes hand in hand with their mining, production, transportation and disposal. Aluminium, for example, is the third most abundant element in the crust of the earth (after oxygen and silicon). It is, perhaps, the element par excellence of our current consumer lifestyle, finding its way into everything from packaging, refrigerators and soft-drinks cans to car wheels, mobile phones and snowboard bindings. But its mining is often dirty, spilling out ‘red mud’ with polluting alkaline. Smelting and casting produces greenhouse gases. Aluminium production is responsible for 1 per cent of all man-made greenhouse-gas emissions – the growing demand for so-called rare-earth elements (used in computer hard drives, loudspeakers and hybrid cars) carries the additional risk of radioactive waste. Since 1960, global aluminium production has increased eightfold. This is not a simple story of mindless waste. The truth is more inconvenient. As industrial countries have developed and got richer, they have built up stocks of aluminium and other metals. It is estimated that three quarters of all aluminium mined in the course of the twentieth century is still in use today – a quarter of this sits in our electrical appliances.

<p>The terms Fonvizin used to characterize Europe appeared with extraordinary regularity in subsequent Russian travel writing. ‘Corrupt’ and ‘decadent’, ‘false’ and ‘superficial’, ‘materialist’ and ‘egotistical’ – such was the Russian lexicon for Europe right up to the time of Herzen’s Letters from France and Italy (1847–52) and Dostoevsky’s Winter Notes on Summer Impressions (1862), a travel sketch which echoed Fonvizin’s. In this tradition the journey was merely an excuse for a philosophical discourse on the cultural relationship between Europe and Russia. The constant repetition of these epithets signalled the emergence of an ideology – a distinctive view of Russia in the mirror of the West. The idea that the West was morally corrupt was echoed by virtually every Russian writer from Pushkin to the Slavophiles. Herzen and Dostoevsky placed it at the heart of their messianic visions of Russia’s destiny to save the fallen West. The idea that the French were false and shallow became commonplace. For Karamzin, Paris was a capital of ‘superficial splendour and enchantment’; for Gogol it had ‘only a surface glitter that concealed an abyss of fraud and greed’.143 Viazemsky <br>

<p>Icons came to Russia from Byzantium in the tenth century, and for the first two hundred years or so they were dominated by the Greek style. But the Mongol invasion in the thirteenth century cut off Russia from Byzantium; and the monasteries, which were largely left alone and even flourished at this time, began to develop their own style. The Russian icon came to be distinguished by qualities that guided the worshipper at prayer: a simple harmony of line and colour and a captivating use of ‘inverse perspective’ (where lines seem to converge on a point in front of the picture) to draw the viewer into the picture space and to symbolize the fact, in the words of Russia’s greatest icon scholar Leonid Ouspensky, that ‘the action taking place before our eyes is outside the laws of earthly existence’.8 That style reached its supreme heights in Andrei Rublev’s icons of the early fifteenth century – an era coinciding with Russia’s triumph over Tatar rule, so that this flowering of sacred art became a cherished part of national identity. Rublev’s icons came to represent the nation’s spiritual unity. What defined the Russians – at this crucial moment when they were without a state – was their Christianity. Readers may recall the last, symbolic scene of Andrei Tarkovsky’s film about the icon painter, Andrei Rublev (1966), when a group of craftsmen cast a giant bell for the ransacked church of Vladimir. It is an unforgettable image – a symbol of the way in which the Russians have endured through their spiritual strength and creativity. Not surprising, then, that the film was suppressed in the Brezhnev years. It is hard to overstress the importance of the fact that Russia received its Christianity from Byzantium and not from the West. It was in the spirit of the Byzantine tradition that the Russian Empire came to see itself as a theocracy, a truly Christian realm where Church and state were united. The god-like status of the Tsar was a legacy of this tradition.9 After the fall of Constantinople to the Turks, the Russian Church proclaimed Moscow to be the Third Rome – the direct heir to Byzantium and the last remaining seat of the Orthodox <br>

<p>Here was the vision of the ‘Russian soul’ – of a universal spirit that would save the Christian world – which Gogol tried to picture in the second and third volumes of Dead Souls. The concept of a national soul or essence was commonplace in the Romantic age, though Gogol was the first to give the ‘Russian soul’ this messianic turn. The lead came from Germany, where Romantics like Friedrich Schelling developed the idea of a national spirit as a means to distinguish their own national culture from that of the West. <br>

<p>It stands to reason that young nations like Germany and Russia that lagged behind the industrializing West would have recourse to the idea of a national soul. What such nations lacked in economic progress they could more than make up for in the spiritual virtues of the unspoilt countryside. Nationalists attributed a creative spontaneity and fraternity to the simple peasantry that had long been lost in the bourgeois culture of the West. This was the vague Romantic sense in which the idea of the Russian soul began to develop from the final decades of the eighteenth century. In his essay ‘On the Innate Qualities of the Russian Soul’ (1792), Pyotr Plavilshikov maintained, for example, that in its peasantry Russia had a natural creativity that had more potential than the science of the West. Carried away by national pride, the playwright even claimed some unlikely firsts: One of our peasants has made a tincture which all the learning of Hippocrates and Galen failed to find. <br>

<p>This ‘Eastern psyche’ was manifested in the Russian people’s tendency to contemplation, in their fatalistic attitudes, in their love of abstract symmetry and universal laws, in their emphasis on religious ritual, and in their ‘udal’ or fierce bravery. According to Trubetskoi these mental attributes were not shared by the Slavs in Eastern Europe, suggesting, in his view, that they must have come to Russia from Asia rather than from Byzantium. <br>

The workers were trained to hammer correctly, for instance, by holding a hammer attached to and moved by a special machine, so that they internalized its mechanical rhythm. The same process was repeated for chiselling, filing and other basic skills.

Ivan had been ‘very cruel’, and Eisenstein could ‘depict him as a cruel man, but’, Stalin explained, you have to show why he had to be cruel. One of Ivan the Terrible’s mistakes was to stop short of cutting up the five key feudal clans. Had he destroyed these five clans, there would have been no Time of Troubles.

<p>The offensive was personally instigated by Stalin. He even studied linguistics, and wrote at length about it in Pravda during 1949, with the aim of denouncing the ‘Jewish’ theory, originally advanced by Niko Marr in the 1900s, that the Georgian language had Semitic origins. <br>

<p>The Soviet system was defined by its belief in science and technology. After 1945 the regime made a huge investment in the scientific establishment, promoting not just nuclear physics and other disciplines that were useful to the military but academic sciences and mathematics, too. The state made science a top priority, elevating scientists to a status on a par with that of senior industrial managers and Party officials. <br>

<p>The Russian Revolution was accompanied by a huge upsurge of apocalyptic science fiction. Bogdanov, the Bolshevik co-founder of Proletkult, took the lead with his science-fiction novels, Red Star (1908) and Engineer Menni (1913), which portrayed the communist utopia on the planet Mars sometime in the middle of the third millennium. <br>

<p>The Georgian film director Otar Ioseliani recalls a conversation with the veteran film-maker Boris Barnet in 1962: He asked me: ‘Who are you?’ I said, ‘A director’ … ‘Soviet’, he corrected, ‘you must always say “Soviet director”. It is a very special profession.’ ‘In what way?’ I asked. ‘Because if you ever manage to become honest, which would surprise me, you can remove the word “Soviet”.’ <br>

<p>Half a million Russians crowded into Charlottenburg and the other south-western suburbs of the German capital in the early 1920s. Berliners dubbed the city’s major shopping street, the Kurfürstendamm, the ‘Nepskii Prospekt’. Berlin had its own Russian cafés, its own Russian theatres and bookshops, its own Russian cabaret. In the suburbs there were Russian grocers, Russian launderettes, Russian pawn shops and Russian antique stores. There was even a Russian orchestra. And a Russian football team (with a young Vladimir Nabokov playing in goal).7 Berlin was the undisputed cultural capital of the Russian émigré community. <br>

<p>Nabokov described the first generation of exiles from Soviet Russia as ‘hardly palpable people who imitated in foreign cities a dead civilization, the remote, almost legendary, almost Sumerian mirages of St Petersburg and Moscow, 1900–1916 (which even then, in the twenties and thirties, sounded like 1916–1900 BC)’. <br>

<p>Emigration tends to breed conservatives in art. Retrospection and nostalgia are its moods. Even Stravinsky found himself moving away from the ultra-modernism of The Rite of Spring, the last major work of his ‘Russian period’, to the neoclassicism of the Bach-like works of his Parisian exile. Others became stuck in the style they had developed in their native land – unable to move on in the new world. This was true of Rachmaninov. Like Bunin’s writing, his music remained trapped in the late Romantic mode of the nineteenth century. <br>

<p>Financial hardship forced Rachmaninov, at the age of forty-five, to start a new career as a piano virtuoso, touring Europe or the US every year. His peripatetic lifestyle left little time for composition. But he himself put his failure to compose down to his painful separation from the Russian soil: ‘When I left Russia, I left behind the desire to compose: losing my country, I lost myself also.’ <br>

<p>But for writers like Nabokov who had yet to find their feet there was little point or prospect in returning to the past. The old generation was dying out and the new becoming less Russian by the day as it assimilated into the mainstream of European culture. To create a new readership such writers had to break out of the mould. Nabokov was the first major writer to complete this literary metamorphosis. <br>

<p>Throughout his life Nabokov complained about the handicap of writing in English – perhaps too often to be totally believed (he once confessed in a letter to a friend that his ‘best work was written in English’).61 Even at the height of his literary prowess he argues, in his 1956 afterword to Lolita, that it had been his ‘private tragedy’ to abandon my natural idiom, my untrammelled, rich and infinitely docile Russian tongue for a second-rate brand of English, devoid of any of those apparatuses – the baffling mirror, the black velvet backdrop, the implied associations and traditions – which the native illusionist, frac-tails flying, can magically use to transcend the heritage in his own way. <br>

<p>Diaghilev, Stravinsky, Benois, Bakst, Shaliapin, Goncharova, Koussevitsky and Prokofiev – they all made Paris home. The effect of the arrival of such émigrés was to accentuate two related facets of Russia’s cultural image in the West. The first of these was a renewed appreciation of the European character of Russian culture as manifested in the so-called ‘neoclassical’ style of Stravinsky, Prokofiev and the Ballets Russes. <br>

<p>This tradition, Stravinsky now maintained, was just as Russian as the folk-based culture which before 1914 the Ballets Russes had pedalled to the West in the form of works like his own Firebird: The music of Tchaikovsky, which does not seem obviously Russian to everyone, is often more profoundly Russian than that which long ago received the superficial label of Muscovite picturesqueness. This music is every bit as Russian as Pushkin’s verse or Glinka’s songs. Without specifically cultivating ‘the Russian peasant soul’ in his art, Tchaikovsky imbibed unconsciously the true national sources of our race. <br>

<p>Balanchine’s affinity for the music of Stravinsky made him the ideal choice for Diaghilev, whose plans for Paris had Stravinsky’s ballets centre stage. The first collaboration between Stravinsky and Balanchine, Apollon Musagète (1928), was the start of a lifelong partnership between composer and choreographer. It was a partnership that would ensure the survival of the modern ballet – Diaghilev’s invention – as an art form. <br>

<p>Stravinsky’s deepest political instinct was a fear of disorder. After teaching for a year at Harvard University, he found his refuge in Los Angeles, where he purchased his first house, a small suburban villa in West Hollywood which would remain his home for the next thirty years. Los Angeles had attracted many artists from Europe, largely on account of its film industry; the German writer Thomas Mann described wartime Hollywood as a ‘more intellectually stimulating and cosmopolitan city than Paris or Munich had ever been’. <br>

Russia liberated Jews like Chagall from the provincial attitudes of their home towns and connected them with the wider world. <br>

<p>Many of the exiles who returned to Stalin’s Russia did so in the knowledge, or with the intuition, that they were going back to a life of slavery. It was a mark of their desperate situation in the West, of their longing for a social context in which they could work, that they were prepared to close their eyes to the harsh realities of the ‘new life’ in the Soviet Union. Homesickness overcame their basic instinct of survival. <br>
