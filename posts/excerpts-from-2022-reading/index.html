<p>Populists love drama. They love drama so much that both leaders and led can find it difficult to distinguish what is real from what is not.1 The line between rhetoric and actually enacting political change blurs. Their outrages tempt their opponents to a response in kind, which risks its own loss of reality. The best way to respond may be simply to ignore the histrionics. That was the path chosen by the Biden transition team, ignoring the increasingly manic attempts by Trump and his entourage to deny their defeat. The result in the final months of 2020 was that the U.S. political system was thrown into an acute state of cognitive dissonance. President-elect Biden and his team went ahead with the transition. They prepared coronavirus responses, climate policies, and plans for a stimulus. Meanwhile, a substantial caucus within the GOP continued to pander to the defeated incumbent and thus to validate his alternate reality. <br>

<blockquote>
<p>On the Democratic side, the main reason to get the second stimulus deal done sooner rather than later was the expectation that as soon as Biden was inaugurated, the GOP would pivot. The party that under Trump had happily voted for huge deficits would rediscover fiscal rectitude and insist on budget balance. They would sabotage Biden as they had done Obama. If the Republicans held the majority in the Senate, fiscal policy would be paralyzed and the entire onus of economic policy would fall on the Fed. The Fed’s instruments were powerful, but they were blunt. The most powerful effect of quantitative easing was through asset markets. Big monetary policy interventions inflated the stock market, benefiting the small minority with substantial equity holdings. If in 2021 monetary policy was left unassisted by redistributive fiscal policy, it was a surefire recipe for progressively increasing inequality. <br>

<p>Whereas U.S. fiscal policy tended to stoke demand for imports, benefiting countries like Germany or China, a Fed with the throttle stuck open had a rather different effect. It weakened the dollar and eased monetary policy throughout the world economy, pushing down interest rates. Econometric testing done since the advent of the QE era showed that this had a strongly positive spillover effect.18 It eased credit and reduced the local currency price of the many commodities that were traded in dollars. <br>

<p>What has made central bankers into the exemplar of modern crisis-fighting is the vacuum created by the evisceration of organized labor, the absence of inflationary pressure, and more broadly, the lack of antisystemic challenge. The interventions can be as large as they are because though they have huge material consequences, and though the bond market itself has a real-world presence in the form of traders and computers and legal documents, central bank asset purchases are the equivalent of waving a digital wand. The monetary spell cast in 2020 was as dramatic as it was because the crisis put at risk the most important market of all, the market for safe Treasury assets. What threatened was an avalanche even greater than that triggered by Lehman. It turned out that in the world of market-based finance, no asset is truly safe unless it is provided with the ultimate backstop. <br>

<p>Health care, social services and social security were consuming three times more than defence as a share of total managed government expenditure. Yet the results were dismal. Increased expenditure on UK welfare had been accompanied by low growth and inflation significantly above the developed world average. A particular problem was chronically slow productivity growth (real GDP per person employed grew by just 2.8 per cent between 1960 and 1979, compared with 8.1 per cent in Japan),54 which in turn seemed closely related to the bloody-minded bargaining techniques of British trade unions (‘go slows’ being a favourite alternative to outright ‘downing tools’). <br>

<p>Suddenly the people running Savings and Loans had nothing to lose - a clear case of what economists call moral hazard.40 What happened next perfectly illustrated the great financial precept first enunciated by William Crawford, the Commissioner of the California Department of Savings and Loans: ‘The best way to rob a bank is to own one.’41 Some S&amp;Ls bet their depositors’ money on highly dubious projects. Many simply stole it, as if deregulation meant that the law no longer applied to them. Nowhere were these practices more rife than in Texas. <br>

<p>On quotas, however, Bruening dug in his heels. His government was lavish in its support for agriculture in every other respect, but on quotas there could be no compromise.107 On this point both Papen and Schleicher followed Bruening’s lead. Papen though he approved quotas in principle, did so only within the limits ‘permissible according to current trade treaties’ and when Papen fell, there was no decisive action by Schleicher.108 This, however, drove the farm lobby into outright opposition to the Republic. 109 In early 1933 key leaders of the agrarian lobby intervened decisively with President Paul von Hindenburg, himself the owner of a large estate, to push him towards accepting a coalition between Hugenberg’s DNVP and Hitler’s Nazi party. <br>

<p>There can be no doubt that the regime paid a serious political price for the economic difficulties of 1934. All the evidence we have on public opinion, mainly from confidential reports by the regional offices of the Gestapo, confirms that in the summer of 1934 the German population was unsettled far more by the economic problems resulting from the foreign exchange crisis than by the violence of the Night of the Long Knives. The simplistic cliché, which sees the Germans as having been won over to Hitler’s regime by the triumphs of work creation, is simply not borne out by the evidence.87 The economic recovery, rapid as it was, was incomplete, even in the first half of 1935. <br>

<p>In the last quarter of 1938, in Berlin, one of Germany’s most important centres of industrial production, the labour exchanges recorded only 35,170 unemployed, of whom at most 6,000 were fully fit. Of these, at least a third were ‘artistic professionals’, would-be actors and musicians, who as paid-up members of the Reich’s corporation of artistic workers enjoyed a protected status. Dealing with this bohemian residuum posed special problems for the officials of the Berlin labour exchanges, who faced ‘fits of temper’ and ‘time-consuming complaints’, if a change of profession was ‘even suggested’. At a time of national emergency, the Berlin trustee of labour was moved to the philistine observation that it was surely unacceptable that ‘such a large number of fully fit Volksgenossen should be exempt from . . . radical occupational redirection’. <br>

<p>Allowing for the fact that the net wealth of Austrian Jewry was reported as just over 2 billion Reichsmarks, it is unlikely that Jewish business capital in Germany far exceeded 850 million Reichsmarks. This was, by any count, a small proportion of the total assets at work in the German economy. Aryanization undoubtedly changed the complexion of major shopping streets in cities like Berlin and Hamburg, and it also changed the structure of property ownership in some highly visible residential neighbourhoods. But its wider impact was limited. Only in a handful of sectors did it cause a major shift in ownership, most notably in retail, particularly in department stores, textiles, clothing and private banking. In general, the idea that the tiny Jewish minority had ever occupied a ‘dominant position’ in the economy and that Aryanization could therefore constitute a major turning point in national economic life, should be seen for what it always was–an absurd anti-Semitic myth. <br>

The billion or so Reichsmarks extracted in both 1938 and 1939 were devastating for the German Jewish community. And for the Reich’s finances they provided welcome relief at a moment of severe fiscal embarrassment. But it is simply unrealistic to imagine that the financial persecution of a tiny and increasingly impoverished minority could make a significant and lasting contribution towards the enormous costs of German rearmament. <br>

By contrast, both the Tokugawa and the Qing restored order through a partnership with local institutions in whose hands they left much of daily administration; extended kin groups occupied a prominent place among these institutions, particularly in China, and the state promoted both their power and ideological centrality far more often than it sought to curb them. <br>

As Braudel points out, in the quotation cited on p. 167, the limitations on earlier “capitalisms” did not result from too little capital.60 They resulted from a lack of adequate outlets for capital in an era before the technologies were available for transforming production processes by investing large sums in fixed plant and equipment. Or to be more precise, the problem was a lack of enough outlets that were more attractive to rich people than investing in titles and other assets that were economically unproductive <br>

A better point, it seems, is that with or without a contribution from overseas coercion, late eighteenth-century Europe still did not have an edge in the way it amassed, protected, or deployed commercial capital (from whatever source) that can explain very much about its long-term path. <br>

Instead it became necessary to treat much of the company’s capital stock as permanent and to retain as much of the profit as possible for circulating capital; this alone made it possible to spread large fixed costs over a sufficiently large volume of trade and adequately compensate investors whose original capital could never be liquidated for return to them. <br>

<p>Millet has already been described as the main constituent of Bemba diet, but it is difficult for the European, accustomed as he is to a large variety of foodstuffs, to realize fully what a “staple crop” can mean to a primitive people. To the Bemba, millet porridge is not only necessary, but it is the only constituent of his diet which actually ranks as food. . . . I have watched natives eating the roasted grain off four or five maize cobs under my very eyes, only to hear them shouting to their fellows later, “Alas, we are dying of hunger. We have not had a bite to eat all day. . . .” <br>

<p>The Bemba do not like to mix their foods, and despise the European habit of eating a meal composed of two or three kinds of dishes.

<p>But some one such single food can be boring, too. People brought up in starch-centered cultures may feel they have not really eaten unless they have had ubwali (tortillas, rice, potatoes, bread, taro, yams, manioc cakes—whatever), but they will also feel that ubwali is not enough unless it is accompanied by umunani. Why this should be so is not entirely clear, but over and over again the centricity of the complex carbohydrates is accompanied by its contrastive periphery. <br>

<p>As recently as a century ago, the combination diet of a single starch supplemented by a variety of other foods, and the constant possibility of widespread hunger—sometimes famine—would have characterized something like 85 percent of the world’s population. Today, this picture still applies in much of Asia, Africa, and Latin America; and the pattern of one-starch “centricity” still typifies perhaps three-quarters of the world’s population. <br>

<p>Florent paced back and forth in the perfume of sun-warmed thyme. He was deeply contented in the wholesome and peaceful earth. For about a year now the only vegetables he had seen were bruised from bouncing in wagons, yanked from the earth the night before and still bleeding. Now he delighted in finding them where they belonged, living peacefully in the earth, their every limb thriving. The cabbages looked stout and prosperous, the carrots were merry, and the lettuces were lined up in lazy nonchalance. The Les Halles that he had left that morning seemed to him to be a sprawling mortuary, a place for the dead scattered with the corpses of the once living, a charnel house with the stench of decomposition. <br>
